# HowdyTTS - A Voice Assistant with Cowboy Charm ü§†

This project is a friendly fork that adds Kokoro TTS support with a cowboy voice, building upon several excellent open-source projects to create a versatile voice assistant with multiple text-to-speech options.

## Credits and Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the following open-source projects:

- [Verbi](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi) - The original voice assistant project that forms the base of this work

## Motivation ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

Welcome to the Voice Assistant project! üéôÔ∏è Our goal is to create a modular voice assistant application that allows you to experiment with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for various components. The modular structure provides flexibility, enabling you to pick and choose between different SOTA models for transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech (TTS). This approach facilitates easy testing and comparison of different models, making it an ideal platform for research and development in voice assistant technologies. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or enthusiast, this project is for you!

## What's New in HowdyTTS? üåü

HowdyTTS adds support for Kokoro TTS with the 'am_michael' voice model, giving your voice assistant a friendly cowboy persona. The project maintains all the flexibility of the original Verbi project while adding this unique voice option.

## Features üß∞

- **Modular Design**: Easily switch between different models for transcription, response generation, and TTS
- **Kokoro Integration**: Use the cowboy voice for a unique assistant personality
- **Support for Multiple APIs**: Integrates with OpenAI, Groq, Deepgram, and Kokoro
- **Audio Recording and Playback**: Record audio from the microphone and play generated speech
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration in `config.py` for easy setup

## Setup Instructions  üìã

#### Prerequisites ‚úÖ

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

#### Step-by-Step Instructions üî¢

1. üì• **Clone the repository**

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi.git
   cd Verbi
```
2. üêç **Set up a virtual environment**

  Using `venv`:

```shell
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
  Using `conda`:

```shell
    conda create --name verbi python=3.10
    conda activate verbi
```
3.  üì¶ **Install the required packages**

```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. üõ†Ô∏è **Set up the environment variables**

Create a  `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
```shell
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
    DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
    LOCAL_MODEL_PATH=path/to/local/model
```
5. üß© **Configure the models**

Edit config.py to select the models you want to use:

```shell
    class Config:
        # Model selection
        TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL = 'groq'  # Options: 'openai', 'groq', 'deepgram', 'fastwhisperapi' 'local'
        RESPONSE_MODEL = 'groq'       # Options: 'openai', 'groq', 'ollama', 'local'
        TTS_MODEL = 'deepgram'        # Options: 'openai', 'deepgram', 'elevenlabs', 'local', 'melotts'

        # API keys and paths
        OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        GROQ_API_KEY = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
        DEEPGRAM_API_KEY = os.getenv("DEEPGRAM_API_KEY")
        LOCAL_MODEL_PATH = os.getenv("LOCAL_MODEL_PATH")
```

If you are running LLM locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), make sure the Ollama server is runnig before starting verbi. 

6. üîä **Configure ElevenLabs Jarvis' Voice**
- Voice samples [here](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi/tree/main/voice_samples).
- Follow this [link](https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-lab/share/de3746fa51a09e771604d74b5d1ff6797b6b96a5958f9de95cef544dde31dad9/WArWzu0z4mbSyy5BfRKM) to add the Jarvis voice to your ElevenLabs account.
- Name the voice 'Paul J.' or, if you prefer a different name, ensure it matches the ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID variable in the text_to_speech.py file.

6. ü§† **Set up Kokoro TTS**

```shell
pip install kokoro
```

For the cowboy voice, use the following settings in config.py:
```python
TTS_MODEL = 'kokoro'
KOKORO_VOICE = 'am_michael'
```

7. üèÉ **Run the voice assistant**

```shell
   python run_voice_assistant.py
```
8. üé§ **Install FastWhisperAPI**

   _Optional step if you need a local transcription model_

   ***Clone the repository***
   ```shell
      cd..
      git clone https://github.com/3choff/FastWhisperAPI.git
      cd FastWhisperAPI
   ```
   ***Install the required packages:***
   ```shell
      pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   ***Run the API***
   ```shell
      fastapi run main.py
   ```
   ***Alternative Setup and Run Methods***

   The API can also run directly on a Docker container or in Google Colab.

   ***Docker:***

   ***Build a Docker container:***
   ```shell
      docker build -t fastwhisperapi .
   ```
   ***Run the container***
   ```shell
      docker run -p 8000:8000 fastwhisperapi
   ```
   Refer to the repository documentation for the Google Colab method: https://github.com/3choff/FastWhisperAPI/blob/main/README.md

8. üé§ **Install Local TTS - MeloTTS**

   _Optional step if you need a local Text to Speech model_

   ***Install MeloTTS from Github***

   Use the following [link](https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS/blob/main/docs/install.md#linux-and-macos-install) to install MeloTTS for your operating system. 

   Once the package is installed on your local virtual environment, you can start the api server using the following command. 
   ```shell
      python voice_assistant/local_tts_api.py
   ```
   The `local_tts_api.py` file implements as fastapi server that will listen to incoming text and will generate audio using MeloTTS model. 
   In order to use the local TTS model, you will need to update the `config.py` file by setting: 

   ```shell
      TTS_MODEL = 'melotts'        # Options: 'openai', 'deepgram', 'elevenlabs', 'local', 'melotts'
   ```
   You can run the main file to start using verbi with local models.
